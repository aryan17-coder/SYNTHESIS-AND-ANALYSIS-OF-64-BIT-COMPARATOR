Designed and implemented a high-performance 64-bit comparator using Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA), leveraging Cadence tools (Genus, Innovus, Tempus) for synthesis, placement, routing, and static timing analysis.

Optimized timing performance by resolving setup and hold violations through buffer insertion and gate resizing, ensuring improved circuit reliability.

Performed power and delay analysis, achieving a 31.7% improvement in efficiency through layout optimization and logic restructuring.

Implemented BRAM data comparison using a 64-bit comparator, enabling fast key-value lookups for memory applications.
